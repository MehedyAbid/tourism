      <article>
        Bangladesh's tourist attractions include historical monuments, resorts,
        beaches, picnic spots, forests and tribal people, wildlife of various
        species. Activities for tourists include angling, water skiing, river
        cruising, hiking, rowing, yachting, and sea bathing.In the northern
        part, comprising the Rajshahi division, there are archaeological sites,
        including the temple city Puthia in Rajshahi; the largest and most
        ancient archaeological site, Mahasthangarh in Bogra; the single largest
        Buddhist monastery, Paharpur in Naogaon; the most ornamental terracota
        Hindu temple, Kantaji Temple, and many rajbaris or palaces of old
        zamindars. In the south-eastern part, which is the Chittagong Division,
        there are natural and hilly areas like Chittagong Hill Tracts, along
        with sandy sea beaches. The most notable beach, in Cox's Bazar, is a
        contender for the title of longest unbroken sandy sea beach in the
        world.Cox's Bazar is the longest natural unbroken sea beach in the
        world. In the south-western part, mainly the Khulna Division, there is
        the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest of the world with royal
        Bengal tiger and spotted deer. The historically and architecturally
        important sixty domed mosque in Bagerhat is a notable site. In the
        north-eastern part, Sylhet division, there is a green carpet of tea
        plants on small hillocks. Natural reserved forests are great
        attractions. Migratory birds in winter, particularly in the haor areas,
        are also very attractive in this area.
